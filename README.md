# BubbleGame

Bubble Popper is an engaging and fast-paced game where players test their reflexes and observation skills. The objective of the game is to pop bubbles with numbers on them before they disappear, while ensuring the correct bubbles are popped to earn points.

## Game Elements:

Bubbles: Colorful bubbles with numbers ranging from 1 to 9 randomly appear on the screen.
Timer: A countdown timer starts from 60 seconds, indicating the time left for the player to pop bubbles.
Score: A score counter keeps track of the player's points, increasing with each correct bubble popped.

## Gameplay:
- At the start of the game, the player is presented with a grid filled with bubbles of random numbers.
- The player's task is to click on the bubbles with numbers corresponding to the target number displayed at the top of the screen.
- Each correct bubble clicked adds 10 points to the player's score.
- The target number changes randomly after each correct bubble is popped, adding an element of unpredictability to the game.
- The player must race against the clock to pop as many correct bubbles as possible before the timer runs out.
- If the player clicks on the wrong bubble or fails to pop bubbles before the timer reaches zero, the game ends.
- The game displays the final score achieved by the player at the end of the game.
